# Welcome to Pokemon Battles!

## Pokemon Battles is simple turn-based fighting game just like the original gameboy games.
## This game is updated in real-time between clients using Socket.io

### After cloning the repository, be sure to run 'npm install' in both the client and server directories. Then make sure you set the port number for the server and client connection (located in the SocketProvider.tsx file) are set to the same value. Run npm start in the client and server directories and you're ready to start playing on your mobile device or simulator using the expo go app!

Here is a brief demo of the game in action:
